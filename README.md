# My Personal Endeavour to Better Myself and Friends

This is my first personal website trying to hone my skills in git and Web Development.

## About Me

My name is Chase Pounders and I am currently a student at Mississippi State University. I am in Web Dev one but I am a junior in Software Engineering.

## About My Project

Me and my friend are going to be working to collaborate on a very VERY basic webpage. The only way to learn is practice.
